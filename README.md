# Precision Farming Project
<<<<<<< HEAD

This project is a precision farming backend platform designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders optimize crop yield and quality using data-driven insights. Built with Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework, it provides a secure and extensible API for managing farm and crop data, with robust user authentication and fine-grained permissions.

## How the System Works

### User Authentication
- **Registration:** Users create accounts using their email and password. The system ensures each email is unique and passwords match.
- **Login:** Users authenticate via a secure login endpoint and receive a JWT token, which is required for all further actions.
- **Token Refresh:** Users can refresh their authentication tokens to maintain secure sessions.

### Permissions & Security
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Some endpoints are public, but most require authentication.
  - Only verified users can perform sensitive actions.
  - Staff/admin users have access to all data; regular users can only manage their own.
- **Ownership Controls:**
  - Users can only modify or delete their own farm and crop data.
  - Read-only access is available for non-owners where appropriate.

### Data-Driven Farming Features
- **Farm Management:**
  - Users can create, view, update, and delete their own farms.
  - Each farm is linked to its creator (the owner).
- **Crop Management:**
  - Users manage crops associated with their farms, with similar permissions and ownership checks.
- **Extensible Design:**
  - The backend is structured to support future features such as sensor data integration and advanced analytics for actionable farming insights.

### Typical User Flow
1. **Sign Up:** Register with email and password.
2. **Login:** Authenticate and receive a JWT token.
3. **Create/Manage Farms and Crops:** Use the API to add, view, or modify farm and crop records securely.
4. **Access Insights (Planned):** The platform is ready for integration with data analytics to provide actionable recommendations in the future.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd com-sci
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Apply database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
7. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
=======
This GitHub repository hosts the codebase for a precision farming project aimed at achieving the best product results with data-driven insights. The project is aligned with the problem statement outlined in precision-farming-for-best-product-results-with-data.

# Problem Statement
Precision farming involves the use of data and technology to optimize various aspects of agriculture, with the ultimate goal of improving crop yield and quality. The problem statement provided by Joash Omondi outlines challenges and opportunities in the domain, and this project seeks to address them through the implementation of a precision farming solution.

For more details on the problem statement, please refer to Joash Omondi Problem Statements.

# Project Overview
The project is implemented using Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework on the Server-side and React on the Client-side. As of now, the focus has been on developing the authentication part of the API backend. This includes user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the precision farming platform.


## Features

- User authentication: Implementing secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
- Authorization: Defining roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the platform.
- Django Rest Framework: Utilizing the power of Django Rest Framework for building robust and scalable API endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Requirements

The app requires the following version of Python to be installed:

* Python 3.x
  

## Installation

To install the app, simply clone the repository:

``

Create a virtual environment for the Django app:

 `python3 -m venv my_env`

Activate the virtual environment:

`source my_env/bin/activate`

Change into the cloned repository:

`cd precision-farming`

After navigating to the repository folder, run the following command to install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run migrations to create the app's database:

`python manage.py migrate`

Create a superuser for the app:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Usage

To use the app, simply run the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Once the server is running, you can access the app at `http://localhost/`
