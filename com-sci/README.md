# Precision Farming Project
This GitHub repository hosts the codebase for a precision farming project aimed at achieving the best product results with data-driven insights. The project is aligned with the problem statement outlined in precision-farming-for-best-product-results-with-data).

# Problem Statement
Precision farming involves the use of data and technology to optimize various aspects of agriculture, with the ultimate goal of improving crop yield and quality. The problem statement provided by Kluster Africa outlines challenges and opportunities in the domain, and this project seeks to address them through the implementation of a precision farming solution.

For more details on the problem statement, please refer to Kluster Africa Problem Statements.

# Project Overview
The project is implemented using Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework on the Server-side and React on the Client-side. As of now, the focus has been on developing the authentication part of the API backend. This includes user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the precision farming platform.


## Features

- User authentication: Implementing secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
- Authorization: Defining roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the platform.
- Django Rest Framework: Utilizing the power of Django Rest Framework for building robust and scalable API endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Requirements

The app requires the following version of Python to be installed:

* Python 3.x
  

## Installation

To install the app, simply clone the repository:

``

Create a virtual environment for the Django app:

 `python3 -m venv my_env`

Activate the virtual environment:

`source my_env/bin/activate`

Change into the cloned repository:

`cd precision-farming`

After navigating to the repository folder, run the following command to install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run migrations to create the app's database:

`python manage.py migrate`

Create a superuser for the app:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Usage

To use the app, simply run the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

Once the server is running, you can access the app at `http://localhost/`
